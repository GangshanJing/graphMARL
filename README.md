# graphMARL
The Matlab codes correspond to the numerical examples in the paper: Jing, G., Bai, H., George, J., Chakrabortty, A. and Sharma, P.K., 2024. Distributed multiagent reinforcement learning based on graph-induced local value functions. IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 69(10), pp.6636-6651.
# How to Run
ZOOLVF.m and Largecase.m provide codes for small-scale cases and large-scale cases, respectively. Both of these two programs are directly runnable. If you find the detailed parameters inconsistent with the ones in the paper, just modify them and rerun the program.
